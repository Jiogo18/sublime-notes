#Notes for Sublime Text

###A _Very_ Simple Language for Taking Notes

If you're like me, you find yourself taking a lot of notes in Sublime. I like syntax highlighting, and I thought it would be cool to see it applied to every day note taking.
Now you can enjoy your beautiful color schemes while taking everyday notes!

 - ___37 major languages supported___
 - simply surround the snippet with [\<language\>] ... [end] to apply syntax highlighting for that language

 - ---- Some Title ----
 - ---== Another Title ==---
- horizontal separators

- highlighting
 - everything after # or between # ... #
- arrows: -->, ==>, <--, <==, etc.
